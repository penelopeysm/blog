  <h1>Hello!</h1>

  <p>
    At long last I&rsquo;ve decided to start collecting classical music concerts
    that I&rsquo;ve attended. I&rsquo;ll try to talk a little bit about what I
    enjoyed (or did not enjoy) about each of them with some justification,
    although these are of course all subjective, and are not intended as a
    review of how <i>good</i> the performance was. Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t have
    full records of concerts before 2024, although I&rsquo;m trying to add those
    I still remember.
  </p>

  <p>
    I&rsquo;m a software engineer at my day job. I love writing Haskell, but
    realistically most of my job is <s>Python</s>
    <s>Julia</s> GitHub Actions. If I have lots of spare time I might write a bit
    about programming or other stuff, but no promises. You can find me on GitHub
    at <a href="https://github.com/penelopeysm" target="_blank">@penelopeysm</a
    >.

  <p>
    This blog is written using Astro, with a fairly bare-bones design. I&rsquo;m
    actually reasonably happy with how it looks, although I miss being able to
    run code examples during the build process (such as with Quarto): the output
    in the source files is hardcoded. In time to come I might consider moving
    the posts with code examples to a different platform.
