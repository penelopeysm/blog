I don't know Tapiola.
It was fine.
Prokofiev was fine too (although I kind of feel it lacked some intensity; I don't know if that's just me having a seat faraway from the stage, or if it was the performance).

I imagine most people came to hear Mäkelä conduct The Rite of Spring.
He's one of the most hyped conductors at the moment: one can't help but wonder whether this is the musicians' opportunity to gauge whether they would like him as their chief conductor in 2034 or whatever.
He's also recently released a recording of Stravinsky's ballets with the Orchestre de Paris.

To be honest, the main thing I noticed about Mäkelä's conducting was that it felt almost exaggerated.
I'm sure he's very talented (otherwise big orchestras wouldn't be lining up to work with him), but sometimes it bordered on theatrical.
Presumably the players already know the piece so well that they wouldn't be distracted.

The performance was great, though; it was full of excitement and very well-controlled.
That said, although I've performed the _Rite_ before, I don't think I actually know it well enough to comment on interpretative choices.
It's something I still kind of struggle with with orchestral music: with a soloist in a concerto, or a recital, it's quite easy to notice when they do something different.
But with an orchestra, it's harder to notice small changes in a score that is really quite expansive.
Maybe this is something I can work on by listening to recordings, I don't know.

Perhaps the more sobering part of this performance was walking out of the door and hearing a couple in front of us remarking that 'he's quite young, he must be in his mid-thirties'.
Him being young is, of course, true.
But if you look up his age, he's in fact not even 30 yet: he's 28 this year, which means that he's younger than me.

I'll bet Klaus can't do web development, though.
