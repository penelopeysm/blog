It's hard to pass up a concert with Bach's solo partitas and sonatas.
Especially when it's only £5!
Shaham's one of those violinists whom I've kind of known (I bought a CD of him playing the Four Seasons many years ago), but have never really followed much.
Today his programme consisted mostly of Bach, but with a sprinkling of contemporary works, which he cheerfully explained to the audience the backstory of.

The contemporary works were fun little pieces, and _When the Violin_ had some interesting sound effects, but I really wanted to enjoy the Bach.
In particular, I've worked on both partitas many years ago, and know them pretty well.
I didn't _super_ enjoy it though.
It felt really quite rushed, and there wasn't really time to let the music breathe – not even between movements, because he had very short breaks between them.
And the intonation wasn't always perfect.
Hilary Hahn has a somewhat famous quote that Bach 'is, for me, the touchstone that keeps my playing honest'.
(By the way, I looked it up and that quote's from _2001_. Can you believe it?!)
I think that in her recordings she lives up to that, but today's concert was a bit less clean that I might have liked, perhaps.

Mind you, my playing's super dirty.
My violin tone quality is terrible by now due to lack of practice, and I wouldn't really want to listen to myself play the Chaconne.

Also, either I had a major memory lapse, or he skipped the D minor Gigue?
I don't rule out the former, though.
It's very possible – I've definitely blanked out during concerts before.
