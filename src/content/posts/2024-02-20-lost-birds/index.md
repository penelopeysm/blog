This isn't a concert review, it's just an album.
Every now and then I get stuck in a loop of listening to _the same thing_ again and again, so I figure I may as well write about some of it.

A couple of weeks ago I decided to put on the 'Choral Chill' playlist on Apple Music Classical, which I have a subscription to.
Then I dozed off on the couch.
I woke up to ... I can't quite remember exactly, but I do remember being utterly amazed by the purity of the singing I was hearing, and I found that it's this a capella group called [VOCES8](https://voces8.com/).

After listening to a whole bunch of VOCES8 stuff and being utterly amazed with their balance, intonation, tone, ... basically everything, I've decided that this album called *The Lost Birds* is the bit of their output I like the most.
The music is written by Christopher Tin (who, with Civilisation IV's *Baba Yetu*, was the first composer to win a Grammy for video game music), and draw on poems by the likes of Emily Dickinson.

Each track is incredibly touching, and I do enjoy the cyclical nature of the album: you see musical themes from the first piece coming back at the end, but in a much more powerful manner.
(Classical purists will say that that's lazy or something.
Look, Bach did the same with the *Goldberg Variations*.
Don't be a classical purist.)

Of course, the fact that it's all about birds aided me greatly in falling for it.
(I love birds!)
The poems themselves are beyond reproach, but I think what's really interesting for me is that setting their words to music makes me feel each word much more than I would if I were just reading it.
I've never managed to get into poetry: it's a sort of 'language' which I've never quite understood.
But *music* (or, at least, classical and classical-adjacent music) is a language that I get, and in this context it seems to act as a kind of bridge for me.

I like the look of the Apple Music embed, so that's what I've put here.
(Also, if you have an Apple Music subscription... like I do... you can sign into the widget and listen to the full piece, not just the preview.)
But, you can get all of this on YouTube too for free!
[Here's a link to the official playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lYhND404bk&list=OLAK5uy_l4aJPR2bRtgGdqnPl_WlO-7lEdvfPFIUY)
The only quibble I have with YouTube is that the transition between successive pieces isn't seamless, which breaks the *attacca* pieces, such as *All That Could Never Be Said* into *I Shall Not See the Shadows*.
