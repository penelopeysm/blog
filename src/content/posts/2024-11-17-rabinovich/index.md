I think I was mainly tempted by the Beethoven: this is quite possibly my favourite of his works.
It's very hard to describe what I like about it: it's something like, a wondrous childlike simplicity in the first movement, but then a steady and unrelenting ascent to grandeur in the final fugue.
While the first half was great, I don't think the Beethoven was _super_ to my liking; it felt a little bit mannered and I feel like I sensed some tempo instability in the fugue, although maybe it was just me.

Mannered playing works perfectly in the Schumann, though.
I think it was a really good traversal of both the Florestan and Eusebius sides of Schumann's personality, including the ghost-like posthumous variations, and the playing really kept me on the edge of my seat!

I _was_ impressed by the encores: Rachmaninoff's G minor prelude (Op. 23 No. 5) and then the Moments Musicaux Op. 16 No. 4.
Both of these are ridiculously virtuosic and I'm amazed that he had the energy to play them after what is already a very demanding programme.
