---------

For the first time in my life, I got to sit down to watch a Prom, after having bought actual tickets :)

I don't have too much to say about this concert.
In many ways, it's a _comfort_ programme; the Mozart is something I put on when I'm feeling a bit down to soothe myself, and the Mendelssohn is something I put on when I want something that's unapologetically cheerful.

I liked McGill's clarinet playing; he imparted a lot of shape the music, even _within_ each phrase, which can be sometimes quite difficult with Mozart (having struggled with his flute concertos).
Also, we got a clarinet encore, which I think is the first time I've ever experienced one!

The seats that we had were not particularly conducive for watching the staging of the Mendelssohn.
However, personally, I was really there for the music!
The full Mendelssohn is not performed super often (I think), so it was nice to hear all of it in a concert setting.
In this sense, it's similar to [_The Nutcracker_, which I wrote about before](/posts/2024-01-09-nutcracker).
It was a very lively performance (the flautist still did very well on the Scherzo passage... I can't do it that fast!)
And of course it's lovely to hear the _Wedding March_ in context.

I should say that Gemma New's conducting was really fun to watch.
She's really expressive, and also has a way of making very clear movements with the baton with not much hand movement at all (I suppose some powerful fingers!)

## Recordings

_A Midsummer Night's Dream_ was one of the last pieces I purchased outright before I took out an Apple Music subscription.
Having listened to quite a lot of recordings, my choice was Philippe Herreweghe's recording with Orchestre des Champs-Élysées.

Apart from it being a period performance (yes, I'm a HIPster! I love the Harmonia Mundi catalogue), I actually like that the tempi are not _too_ fast: the Scherzo, for example, isn't rushed at all.
Despite not being super fast, it is still very rhythmic with all the semiquavers being impeccably placed, and I think there's a huge sense of satisfaction listening to a fast piece where the orchestra _doesn't_ rush.

The vocal bits are also very well balanced and recorded, the singers don't stand out too much but meld into the orchestral texture very nicely.
This perhaps reflects Herreweghe's experience with choral works.

If there's one complaint I have with this recording, it's that it uses Mendelssohn's original German text, but that's a very minor quibble.
