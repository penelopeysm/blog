## My thoughts

I managed to recover from Covid _just in time_ to go for this concert.
The District line was down, and I thought that it would be super annoying for me to get there, but it turns out that actually... rail replacement buses are pretty fast.
I'm never going to slander rail replacement buses again.

This was one of Pappano's opening concerts as the new Chief Conductor of the LSO.
I haven't seen him conduct before, but he managed to rank fourth on a (rather unscientific) 2023 poll of the ['World's Best Conductor'](https://bachtrack.com/worlds-best-orchestra-best-conductor-critics-choice-september-2023).
I think he definitely brought a heightened sense of drama to the pieces, not least the Berlioz, which was quite a fun opening piece.

No doubt the stars of the show were meant to be Wang and Lapwood.
I think this is the third or fourth time I've seen Yuja Wang perform now, and in fact, this is the second time I've seen her play this concerto; the first time was at the Royal Festival Hall.
To be entirely honest, I think I would have preferred to see the concert on the 19th where she's scheduled to play Chopin 2 with the LSO.
She's sometimes criticised for being overly virtuosic, which I think is actually rather unfair because although she does have a ridiculous amount of technique and isn't afraid of showing it off, she doesn't _only_ do that.
See, for example, the opening of this recent performance of Glass's Etude No. 6:

which is beautifully muted compared to Ólafsson (another pianist I really like), who plays it much more percussively:

But anyway, playing Rachmaninoff puts her firmly into virtuosic territory, including a first movement cadenza which I can hardly characterise as anything _but_ percussive.
Oh well.
Still, it was good, and she graced the hungry concertgoers with one encore which I had heard before but struggled _super_ hard to find the name of but couldn't.
I've since discovered it's a Mendelssohn piece, the Song Without Words Op. 67 No. 2, and I'm still slightly sore that I couldn't place it at the time.
My ego will recover, it's fine.

One thing that did strike me was the acoustics of the Barbican are really more enjoyable than those of the Royal Festival Hall.
I remember her playing Rach 1 at the RFH and it felt very, very distant, as if I was watching from afar.
The sound in the Barbican was much more immediate.

The second half of the concert was just Saint-Saëns, making for what felt like a slightly short programme overall.
It was very good, and I particularly enjoyed the pianists' little dances, but I can't help but feel that it is a little unfair to give _only_ the organist so much credit for the piece.
Even Lapwood would agree with me (see below!).
Not that I'm complaining about her playing at all; it was particularly delicious in the slow section of the first movement.
I'm a big fan of her work, too, and it felt quite fitting to have two female musicians headline this concert.
