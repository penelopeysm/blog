*(Despite the date on this post, I'm writing this on 20 Feb 2024.)*

I don't remember much from this concert to write anything lengthy, so I'll leave it at this: Argerich was incredible, and this is probably one of the earliest concerts I remember coming away from with a strong impression.

Her first encore was Schumann-Liszt *Widmung*, which inspired me to go and practice it for a not insignificant amount of time.
I never got anywhere (of course), but I guess it was fun...
(The second encore was a Scarlatti sonata.)
