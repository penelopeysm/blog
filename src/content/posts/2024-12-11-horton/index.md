I enjoyed it!
It's always nice to hear this music.

I _do_ think that I have a very high bar for the Chopin: my favourite recording is by Ivo Pogorelich, and in that recording he imbues each of them with really extreme characterisation.

I suppose some people might think that that's a bit much, but as much as we might like to think of the Preludes as a 'three-movement work', it is still really a set of miniatures, each of which has its own life; and that the contrasts between the preludes are what sets it apart from the rest of Chopin's work.

I don't really think that today's concert quite matched that, but I'm not sure who would!
Most recordings of the Preludes can really feel a bit boring after listening to Pogorelich.
Yet, today's recording had plenty of colour—certainly enough to make for enjoyable listening.
This was true in both the Debussy and Chopin, and the encore of the 'Aeolian Harp' etude was also beautifully rendered.
