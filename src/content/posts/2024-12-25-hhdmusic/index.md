Alright, not a concert this time but still music-related.

In times gone by I used to do various transcriptions, mostly of Studio Ghibli music.
I've lost all these now, but today I spent maybe 1.5 hours putting together this transcription of the _Downtown_ music from _Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer_.

Here's the original:

Here's my transcription:

Featuring cameos by the shamisen (four notes) and glockenspiel (five notes).
This instrumentation obviously isn't very suited to home recording, but I might try to put something together with substitute instruments at some point!

If anyone wants it, you can download the MuseScore file [here](/HHDDowntown2.mscz).

I think I can now declare Christmas a success :)
