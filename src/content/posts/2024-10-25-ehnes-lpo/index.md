----------

Ack, I'm actually writing this almost a month after the concert, so I don't remember much.
Add to the fact that I don't know the pieces very well... (apart from the Bruch, which I've attempted to play a few times before).
So I don't really have anything intelligent to write.
So, this post will just exist to say that I went to this concert!
