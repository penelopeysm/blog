Vengerov was a replacement for Martha Argerich.
Unfortunately Oxford Phil decided to play the Mendelssohn concerto, which they had played just a month ago, and one which is already (arguably) overperformed.
I figure that they probably felt they had to bring in a big name as a replacement, and probably this was what he could perform at short notice.
But as much as I like listening to these repertoire staples, I've long thought that the Oxford Phil's programming is way too conservative, and it's a shame that what was probably my last concert in Oxford did nothing to dispel this notion.

I can't say I particularly remember anything about the performance itself standing out.
I probably wasn't in a super good mental state anyway because of the house moving, so I'll leave it at that.
