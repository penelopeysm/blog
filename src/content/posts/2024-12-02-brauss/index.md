I'm _super_ behind on writing about the concerts I attended, but I really liked this one.

The programme itself is quite a fun one.
It has a super traditional structure going forwards in time, but the pieces are all thematically linked by the idea of 'farewell'.
At the same time, there's some really good balance between the pieces.
Schumann's Geistervariationen isn't played very often: one could conjecture several reasons for this – for example, it's a bit one-dimensional (compared to his other works for piano) and perhaps, like his violin concerto, people think that it's a product of Schumann's mental illness.
But the rather downcast mood of that is a nice appetiser to the Prokofiev, which is intensely rhythmic and virtuosic.

Brauss's playing, I find, is very introverted: it's a kind of playing that draws you into the music, rather than trying to make an impression.
Listening to the Bach _Capriccio_ was slightly interesting, because although this piece isn't one of his most popular works, I've heard Andras Schiff play it twice.
In Brauss's hands, the posthorn dropping-octaves were a bit more gentle, which sounded slightly like the distant call of the coach travelling away.
If I'm allowed one complaint, the voices in the second-movement fugue weren't super clear.
But I definitely still enjoyed it.
In fact, her tone reminds me a little bit of Angela Hewitt's recording of the WTC, which is similarly inviting.

I think that this playing style also fit perfectly with Schumann's variations: instead of dismissing it the work of a madman, I felt almost like I was being invited into Schumann's inner thoughts.
And I feel that that almost makes you a bit more empathetic.
(Also, one can't help but feel that Clara must have suffered a lot, too.)
As an encore to the Schumann, Brauss played the last movement from _Waldszenen_.
Leaving the concert I checked on Apple Music to see if she had recorded the entire set, but was actually rather disappointed to find a relative lack of recordings.
I'd definitely listen more if I could.

By the way, such a description may make one think that technique was compromised on.
That would not have been a fair statement, though; the Prokofiev was very cleanly executed, especially the _perpetuo moto_ third movement which had impressive rhythmic control and precision.
(By the way, that movement's part of Yuja Wang's encore set list, which is probably a good marker of it being showy.)
