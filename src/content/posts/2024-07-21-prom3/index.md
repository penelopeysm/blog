[I've written about VOCES8 before!](/posts/2024-02-20-lost-birds)
After hearing them on Apple Music I went to look for their upcoming concerts, and was quite disappointed to find none in London... and then this Prom popped up, and I just _had_ to go for it, despite the 11am start (and the fact that the District line west of Earl's Court was shut!).

(I'm sorry, King's Singers, you were great too, but I'm here for VOCES8.
Okay, if you want me to say something about them: I think the vocal profile feels unbalanced to me because of the lack of sopranos or a genuine alto.
Countertenors hit the same pitches, obviously, but the timbre / resonance is different.
There, I said it.
But they were definitely very, very technically proficient.)

To be honest I'm not sure I have anything super insightful to say.
Although I have some experience messing with my vocal characteristics, I don't actually have experience of singing in a choir.
Of course, I can _appreciate_ just how difficult it is to sing in perfect harmony and perhaps more so, to taper the voices so that they blend seamlessly into one single voice.
I think that this was actually done better in the arrangements which _didn't_ have all 14 singers on stage at once, and perhaps the most satisfying bits were the just-VOCES8 pieces because they felt less 'fuzzy' to me (for lack of a better description).

Another point is that this kind of harmony requires, I think, singing in a just intonation; and I've never been able to understand how that really works in practice, _especially_ with modulations, because surely that means that the goalpost keeps shifting?
If you sing a G in G major, it's going to be different from a G in Eb major, for example.
I don't think I would ever be able to do that myself, not even on the violin.

Anyway, it was a wonderful concert!
I don't think that I was emotionally touched in the way that _The Lost Birds_ affected me (that one really hit the exact sweet spot of birds + beautiful words + soaring music), but I can't help but feel that everything is right when I hear chords that are so perfectly in tune.
I'm glad that the Proms includes things that aren't really 'classical'—obviously the performance is rooted in a classical tradition, but many of the pieces are arrangements of pop songs or folk songs.

I did find it mildly funny that the singers needed a reference pitch to start some of the pieces.
This is not a dig at them—rather it was just a reminder that, despite the almost superhuman skill, they are still mortal in some ways!
