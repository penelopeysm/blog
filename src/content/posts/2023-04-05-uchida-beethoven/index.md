## My thoughts

*(Despite the date on this post, I'm writing this on 20 Feb 2024.)*

I remember being really excited about this concert, because I have Uchida's 2006 album of the same three sonatas, which I really rate:

And I think these sonatas are pretty much the pinnacle of late Beethoven.
Collectively they're introspective yet ecstatic, subdued yet grand, ...

I think though right from the start Uchida seemed technically uncomfortable.
This maybe isn't very surprising because she is getting a little bit old.
And while it's easy to forgive a couple wrong notes, sometimes it gets to the point where I'm mentally prepping myself for the next wrong note, which makes it hard to enjoy...

In terms of the interpretations, I can't quite put my finger on why but I don't think it really compared with the 2006 recording.
I think that these sonatas are really meant to be a glimpse into heaven (or whatever we think heaven is).
And while I think Uchida's recording is the closest I've found to that, I didn't get the feeling that the live performance reached those lofty heights.
I would say that I felt that the performance felt a bit disjointed, but I don't know if that was actually the playing or just my perception of it.

All in all I've learnt that maybe it's not a good idea to try and watch your favourite but slightly aged performers (unless their name is Martha Argerich).
I had a similar experience with Maurizio Pollini a few years ago, and the last I saw of Maria João Pires on YouTube she seemed to also be struggling with comparatively technically easy pieces.
While I have nothing but the greatest of respect for all of these pianists (obviously, their playing at 70 or 80 is still way better than mine will ever be) I think I would prefer to remember them at their very best.

## Recordings

Give that Uchida recording a listen, it's really well worth it.
It'd be one of my desert island recordings for sure.
Here is the Op. 111:

More recently I've been listening to a lot of period-instrument performances.
My favourite is Penelope Crawford:
