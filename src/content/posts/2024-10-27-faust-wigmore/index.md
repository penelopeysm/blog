----------

I remember this concert a little better than the [previous one](../../posts/2024-10-25-ehnes-lpo)... perhaps it's just because I know this music a bit better, and also it's a concert that I had really intended to go for.
Anyway, I think I must have bought this at a time where I really liked Schubert.
Although I still do, I've really been starting to feel that Schubert's pieces are too long and requires way too much concentration...
The quartet and quintet of this performance both fit that bill, in my opinion: their opening movements are almost 20 minutes each.

As it happens, I was rather stingy and got myself a seat at the back of the hall.
And for reasons that aren't entirely clear to me, they kept some lights on near the back.
So I made the most of it by reading _a book_ during the performance (George Eliot's _Middlemarch_).
I do sort of wonder what the people around me thought of that!
I did make sure to flip pages without making any noise, but I'm sure that it wasn't very conventional.

As for the music itself, it was fine!
I'm writing this article about a month late, so I can't really remember the _exact_ points I wanted to write down, even though I do remember making some notes in my head on the day.
I suppose I'll have to let it slide.
I do remember that they tuned between _every_ movement, which did get a little bit distracting—I wonder what was up with the conditions that day.
