## My thoughts

Despite the date on this post, I'm writing this on 20 Feb 2024.
So, this concert was more than 4 years ago and notably was pre-pandemic so I really don't remember much!

I do remember though, that M. and I met at South Kensington tube, grabbed something to eat from Pret, and then got some *very* good standing spots in the RAH Arena and the sound was *amazing*.
(And of course I was super excited to see Yuja Wang, whose ascent to stardom is well-documented.)
The Rachmaninoff has been preserved on YouTube:

In particular, I remember being enthralled by the rhythmic tension at 8:30 onwards.
Notice how Wang lengthens notes like those I highlighted below:

I think this was one of the first times I was *entirely* taken in by the music I was listening to.
So I wasn't really conscious of what was going on around me: I was just listening intensely.
It doesn't happen often.
