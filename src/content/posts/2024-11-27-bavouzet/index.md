As can be seen from the programme, this is really meant to put Debussy's music in context with other composers' works.
Bavouzet has been doing a cycle of Debussy's works at Wigmore Hall, likewise paired with 'equivalent' compositions, and this was the last concert in the series: the programme that was printed unusually contained 4 pages instead of the usual 2, with the last two pages listing all the concerts in the series.
(Annoyingly, I was looking at some of the programmes and thinking it'd be nice to go for them, and then I realised that they were all in the past. It seems a bit weird to print it given that the audience can't do anything useful with the information, but anyway.)

Debussy is one of my favourite composers.
But I do find it interesting that both Bavouzet today, and also [Thibaudet a few months back](/posts/2024-01-24-thibaudet-debussy)—both are French and have a 'specialism' in Debussy—don't tend to linger in the 'dreaminess' which can often be associated with Debussy's music; their playing seems to be more direct and a little more forceful in terms of tone.
That naturally makes me wonder whether there is a cultural aspect to this.

Anyway, the most interesting part to me was probably the Stockhausen, which Bavouzet preceded with a few words of introduction (probably a good decision given how weird it is).
I don't think that the piece is musically my cup of tea, but it's curious how many of the Klavierstücke have mathematical underpinnings—in this case, the Fibonacci sequence.
I'm not sure if this really affects the listening experience, but I think it's an interesting example of how connections can be drawn between seemingly disparate concepts.
It's a little bit like how synesthesia can link sounds with e.g. colours, but in this case it's linking sounds to numbers.

Bavouzet also mentioned how Stockhausen wanted to create the notion of 'distance' as another dimension to the music.
I'm writing this about a month late so I can't remember if he tied this to Debussy's music, but there's definitely a lot of Debussy's music which uses this concept of distance: the ending of _Feux d'artifice_ springs to mind, with the _La Marseillaise_ quotation in the background.

All in all this was not only nice to listen to but somewhat educational!
