## My thoughts

For the first time in my life, I got to sit down to watch a Prom, after having bought actual tickets :)

I don't have too much to say about this concert.
In many ways, it's a _comfort_ programme; the Mozart is something I put on when I'm feeling a bit down to soothe myself, and the Mendelssohn is something I put on when I want something that's unapologetically cheerful.

I liked McGill's clarinet playing; he imparted a lot of shape the music, even _within_ each phrase, which can be sometimes quite difficult with Mozart (having struggled with his flute concertos).
Also, we got a clarinet encore, which I think is the first time I've ever experienced one!

The seats that we had were not particularly conducive for watching the staging of the Mendelssohn.
However, personally, I was really there for the music!
The full Mendelssohn is not performed super often (I think), so it was nice to hear all of it in a concert setting.
In this sense, it's similar to [_The Nutcracker_, which I wrote about before](/posts/2024-01-09-nutcracker).
It was a very lively performance (the flautist still did very well on the Scherzo passage... I can't do it that fast!)
And of course it's lovely to hear the _Wedding March_ in context.

I should say that Gemma New's conducting was really fun to watch.
She's really expressive, and also has a way of making very clear movements with the baton with not much hand movement at all (I suppose some powerful fingers!)
