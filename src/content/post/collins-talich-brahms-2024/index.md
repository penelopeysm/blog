## My thoughts

I don't really have much to say about this one!
I thoroughly enjoyed myself and while the highlight of the entire programme (for me) was the *Clarinet Quintet*, everything else was extremely well done.
The elaborate clarinet solos in the second movement were melancholy enough to draw a tear; but Collins never made it all about himself, allowing Brahms's writing to shine through.

Honestly, I think the most impressive thing of this performance was the sheer length!
I think I left the concert hall at 18:45.
