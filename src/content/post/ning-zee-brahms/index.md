## My thoughts

I moved to London a few months ago and have been intending to use this opportunity to go for more classical concerts, so I turned up for this all-Brahms programme mostly on a whim.

Well, not really: I'd heard violinist Ning Feng (ÂÆÅÂ≥∞) play at one of the Wigmore Monday lunchtime recitals, and I thought he was pretty good.
As it happens, I've also been playing some of the Brahms violin sonatas myself: particularly the first movements of Opp. 78 and 100.
(So, you'll have to forgive me for focusing on the violin part in this review.)
Coupled with the fact that this was ¬£5 for under-35s, it was a no-brainer to go for this.

I was not really sure what I was expecting, but it was really amazing!

I would say that the repertoire is about 70% of why I attend a concert (yes, I'm boring like that!).
And obviously, the music is great: this is Brahms at his most lyrical and intimate.
But the performance really matched it.
Ning's tone is silky, very smooth, and not at all aggressive: this is a quality that I've come to appreciate more in recent years.
I think that really shines in pieces like these sonatas, which really aren't technically virtuosic, but speak to the heart directly.
(Not that technical virtuosity was lacking here: Ning's intonation was almost perfect apart from one or two hiccups at the very start.)
In contrast, I don't really enjoy listening to violinists like Oistrakh play these sonatas any more.

A particularly touching moment was the high A at the end of the first movement of Op. 78:

It's so tempting to play the high A loud, because it's the very peak of the phrase.
(And Brahms *does* write *sempre cresc.* the bar before this!)
Instead of that, though, Ning went into what was almost a mezzo-piano, which to me was wistful and poignant: it conjured an image of something beautiful in the clouds, tangible, but unreachable.

I really thought the whole set was incredibly beautiful.
I don't know what the rest of the audience was thinking, because somehow I was the only person to give a standing ovation at the end. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
But, even though there is a lot of social pressure to not stand out amongst a crowd, I'm learning to not care about what other people think and to just stand when I think it is warranted.
In my experience, people tend give standing ovations to artists they *think* are good, even when the performance really isn't all that amazing.

I'm scheduled to watch Hilary Hahn, who's genuinely my all-time favourite violinist, play the same repertoire in March.
I am struggling to imagine how it will be better!

## Recordings

On the way back, I discovered that the same artists had recorded the same repertoire recently, with similarly enjoyable violin playing (although the live version was better):

Separately, I've also been enjoying the recording of the Brahms sonatas by Isabelle Faust and Alexander Melnikov.
