## My thoughts

First of all, pardon the awkward URL slug.
It's like this because I need to get it to sort lexicographically lower than Prom 3 so that it shows up 'later' in the list of posts.
Maybe I can fix this in the code at some point in time, but I'm sleepy, and really quite tired after going for [two Proms today](/posts/2024-07-21-prom3), standing for both, and to top it off taking the bus there both times because the train was not running.

That said, I'd totally do it again in a heartbeat!

This concert was Mark Elder's last Prom with the Hallé, after 25 years as their chief conductor.
I've heard him conduct Mahler before: he was a last-minute replacement for Mahler 3 at the Southbank a few months ago now.
At that time I didn't know Mahler 3 and I just popped in because I felt like it (OK, I was sad because I was house hunting in London), but I remember exiting the concert hall thinking that it was a really great symphony.
It's hard to tell whether it was the composer or the conductor that made it so great, of course, but when you have the same combination of composer and conductor you don't _need_ to know!

While I can't pick out any bits I _didn't_ like of today's performance, I do know what I like, and it's the pacing that Elder brought.
I felt like the symphony _made sense_: I didn't, at any point, wonder what was coming next, because it almost seemed obvious when it happened.
Another nice touch was the slightly under-tempo, more stately entrance of the horns in the 3rd movement.
By way of contrast, I can't help but feel that this was lacking in the MTT Mahler 3 performance in May.
Mahler 5 is different, of course: it's rather more straight-to-the-point, and despite the beautiful Adagietto, it doesn't quite survey as much of the musical landscape as Mahler 3 does, and is perhaps slightly less challenging.
Even then, I think it highlights the importance of an agile conductor in these large-scale works.

The orchestra played with distinction, with one flubbed note in the brass perhaps the only thing that was noticeably off.
Much credit also has to be given to the choirs for the very grandiose MacMillan piece, although I won't comment on that as I don't quite know it.
