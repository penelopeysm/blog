## My thoughts

Okay: this really *isn't* a classical concert.
But I have an incredible fondness for Tchaikovsky's *Nutcracker*: it's such a cheery piece with all sorts of catchy themes stuffed inside, and every time I put it on it never fails to lift my mood.

The problem with this is, of course, people don't tend to programme the entire *Nutcracker* into a classical concert.
The music is somewhat repetitive. (Not as bad as *Swan Lake* though...)
Sometimes people play the suite, but that's not enough to satisfy my cravings.

So when Christmas came round and I had the opportunity to watch this I could not help but jump!
I've also never actually watched ballet before, except for maybe a little bit of *Swan Lake* on YouTube.
So I thought this would be a good way for me to branch out from the traditional sit-down-and-close-your-eyes type of classical concert.

It _was_ excellent!!

M. and I were both very impressed at how the choreography managed to tell a pretty complex story.
I got a little sniffly at several scenes, especially when Clara's brother broke the Nutcracker toy.

I think for me the biggest insight is how the music lines up with the story.
Prior to this, I had only listened the music on its own.
Although I of course knew the programmatic nature of the piece, I didn't realise just how closely it was synchronised with specific events in the narrative.

For example, this really struck me:
it is when the Prince is recounting the fight to the Sugar Plum Fairy.
Notice the key change from D minor to E flat major at 3:24, which ushers in a beautifully *legato*, soaring melody.
That's exactly when the Prince says: _'and then Clara stepped in and saved me'_!
(Or at least, it was in this production: and it _makes so much sense_ that I can't see it any other way.)

I'm sure there are so many more moments like these that I totally missed.
I'd love to be able to watch it back again.

As for the orchestral playing, I didn't think it was particularly superlative.
Indeed, I was very quickly reminded that the dancers would not be able to keep up with some of the tempi in the recordings I'm used to!
But there was little to complain about on the music side, and honestly, by a few minutes in I was too focused on the ballet itself to think too much about whether the music was a 6, 8, or a 10.

The only sad thing is that it was *expensive*.
We got Â£50 tickets, which is substantially more than we would ordinarily have paid for a classical concert.
(In this case I was responsible for buying the tickets, so it's really my fault!)

I do recognise that the money goes not only towards the orchestra but also the dancers, and I don't begrudge that at all.
I suppose it's just as well that Christmas only comes round once a year!

## Recordings

I used to really like Valery Gergiev's recording with the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra, and from a *musical* point of view I still do because the playing is energetic and rhythmic, but I can't really listen to him in good conscience any more.

So let's go with Simon Rattle and the Berlin Phil, which is also quite a fun listen:
